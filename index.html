	<h3>Step 1 - Make sure you have all your pieces, hardware and tools.</h3>
<p>You will need a skateboard deck, trucks, wheels, bearings, and the typical skate hardware; 8 screws and 12 washers. For tools you’ll need to find a cheap skate tool or a wrench, and an x-acto knife.</p>
</section>


<section class="step3">
<h3>Step 3 - Begin by taking your deck pile, and applying your griptape to the bare deck.</h3>
<p>The grip will come in a square shape, but not to worry, apply it like a sticker to the top of the deck making sure to rub out any air bubbles that form. Use the x-acto knife around the edge of the top of the board, to cut off the excess tape. Last, poke the screws through the 8 holes in the board so they also penetrate the grip.</p>
</section>


<section class="step5">
<h3>Step 5 - Now that we have the deck and trucks ready, it’s time to attach them.</h3>
<p>Take your trucks and align the bushings inwards, facing each other. Hold the trucks in place on each end of your board and push the 8 screws through the top of the deck and through the trucks completely. Finish by putting the last 8 washers on the back of these screws, making sure the trucks are tightly fitted to the bottom wood of the deck.</p>

<h3>Step 2 - Organize your hardware by skateboard part.</h3>
<p>Separate your materials in these groups: wheels with bearings and 4 washers. Deck with griptape and x-acto knife. Trucks with 8 screws, and 8 washers.</p>
</section>


<section class="step4">
<h3>Step 4 - After getting your deck ready, it’s time to connect the wheels with the trucks.</h3>
<p>Take your wheels, and put a bearing in each side of each wheel. Push them in so they fit tight, then slide the wheels onto the ends of each truck, so that all 4 wheels are in place. Lastly, use 4 washers to hold the wheels on by screwing them onto the outside of the truck.</p>
</section>


<section class="step6">
<h3>Step 6 - Ride Out</h3>
<p>Now that our board is all together and stable, go take a ride and pop a few ollies to make sure everything is secure. You can also tighten or loosen the trucks to your favor, by simply taking the skate tool or wrench to the washer in the center of each truck and tweaking the looseness. Tighter trucks are more stable, while looser trucks allow more movement. Take your new board to the park and tear that shit up.</p>
